	This build script is used to download dependencies for a freshly downloaded
	binary distribution of Ivy without dependencies.

	To use it, you only need to have this script in the directory where you
	have unzipped your binary distribution of Ivy, and to call it using
	ant -f build-install.xml

	If you don't want to download all optional dependencies, you can set
	the conf attribute value in the ivy:retrieve task, to select only
	the configuration you want (check the ivy.xml for details about
	which configurations are available, and what they are useful for).

			we use ivyrep for ivy and some artifacts, and ibiblio for other artifacts
			The reason for that is that commons vfs is still not released, thus we depend on an integration
			version only available on ivyrep, but not on ivyrep
			As soon as vfs will be available on ibiblio, the default configuration could be used again
